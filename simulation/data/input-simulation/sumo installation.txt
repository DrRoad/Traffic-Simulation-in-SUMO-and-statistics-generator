# xQuartz needs to be installed and possibly already opened; for it to open the simulation the documentation states to log in and out once (I suppose it means restart the terminal and / or computer)

# kirchheim.sumocfg, gui-settings-dr.cfg, kirchheim.net.xml, kirchheim.rou.xml are needed

# Start simulation GUI from command line: navigate to data/input-simulation folder on improve-simulation-visualisation branch
# or just save folder from USB drive to presentation Mac

# -g argument loads gui settings file
