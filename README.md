# Traffic-Simulation-in-SUMO-and-statistics-generator in Python
Still under development. A lot of parts cannot be shown due to privacy reasons of the client.


-Generate traffic simulations using SUMO. 
-Generate statistics from the simulation outputs. 
-Some parsers are sequential, i.e. they can parse very large XML files sequentially.
-There is also a gpx to csv latitude-longitude converter which works for very large files. Suitable for heatmaps from large amounts of data
