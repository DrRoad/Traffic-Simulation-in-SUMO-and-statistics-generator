# Traffic-Simulation-in-SUMO-and-statistics-generator in Python
Still under development. A lot of parts cannot be shown due to privacy reasons of the client.


-Generate traffic simulations from SUMO(Simulation of Urban MObility). The traffic simulation can be seen inside a Graphical User Interface.
-Generate statistics from the simulation outputs. Some statistics are generated using pandas.
-Some parsers are sequential, i.e. they can parse very large XML files sequentially.
-I have also created a gpx to csv(which contains latitude-longitude) converter which works for very large files. These csv files are suitable for generating heatmaps, for example in HERE maps.
